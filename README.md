This is a slight adaptation of a wonderful notebook from Sanchit Gandhi for fine-tuning the Whisper speech-to-text model from OpenAI.  Please see his Hugging Face blog entry of 3 November 2022 called Fine-Tune Whisper for Multilingual ASR with Transformers. 

Here we add our own domain-specific MP3 audio files with corresponding transcriptions in order to fine-tune the Whisper model on the jargon of a particular domain.
