## Fine-Tuning Whisper Speech-to-Text Model for Domain-Specific Jargon
### Introduction
This Python notebook provides a step-by-step process to fine-tune a speech-to-text model for a given domain with its unique jargon. This is a slight adaptation of the excellent notebook from Sanchit Gandhi for fine-tuning the Whisper speech-to-text model from OpenAI.  Please see his Hugging Face blog entry of 3 November 2022 called Fine-Tune Whisper for Multilingual ASR with Transformers. 

Speech-to-text models are generally trained on a wide range of audio data, making them versatile but not always perfectly suited for specialized domains with unique terminology and vocabulary. Fine-tuning allows us to adapt a pre-trained model to better understand and transcribe audio data within a specific domain.

### Getting Started
1. Data Collection:
Gather a substantial amount of audio data specific to your domain. This dataset should ideally contain a wide range of accents, speaking styles, and content relevant to the domain.
2. Transcription:
Transcribe the audio data into text. You can use the pre-trained Whisper large model to assist with the process of generating a verbatim transcription.
3. Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess both the audio and text data. Remove any irrelevant information and ensure text and audio file pairs are correctly matched. The train.tsv and test.tsv files are expecting two tab-separated columns: path and script.  The path specifies the location of the audio file, e.g. audio/myaudiofile1.mp3.  The script is the text transcription of the audio file.
4. Fine-Tuning:
Use the provided Python notebook (wsprtune.ipynb) to fine-tune the pre-trained Whisper small speech-to-text model. Customize the notebook to use the larger or smaller versions of the model depending on the compute resources you have available.

### Deploy and Inference
Customize the final cell in the wsprtune.ipynb notebook to launch a Gradio graphical interface for using the fine-tuned model in a processing pipeline.

### Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this README and using the provided Python notebook, you can adapt a pre-trained speech-to-text model to specialize in transcribing audio data within a specific domain, incorporating the unique jargon and lexicon of that domain.
